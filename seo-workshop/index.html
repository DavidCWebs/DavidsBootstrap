                    <p class ="lead">Search engines (like Google, Yahoo! and Bing) are basically robots that read every website on the internet, 
                    creating an index based on what they read.</p>
                    <p class="lead"> When a user searches for a term in Google, the search engine goes through the index that
                     it created when it last crawled the web.</p>
                     <p class="lead">Google then displays the search results that it thinks are most relevant for the user, 
                     based on the search terms they used.</p>
                    <p class="lead">The order in which Google displays results is based on the popularity of the various sites, 
                    keyword density, and other factors - so the user sees a list of sites that the search engine believes are most relevant, ranked accordingly.</p>
                    <p class ="lead">The words used on your site also help your users to decide whether or not your content is relevant to them.</p>

                    <p class="lead">An effective search engine optimisation (SEO) strategy requires:
							<ul class="lead">
							<li>An understanding of users & their search workflow</li>
							<li>Clear website goals</li>
							<li>Alignment of site content with users needs: site structure, content quality and keywords</li>
							<li>Agility: iteration on a cycle of measurement, evaluation and improvement</li>							
							</ul>                    
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">Above all else, you should create rich, useful content that naturally incorporates the keywords that potential visitors actually search for.</p>
                    <h3>Users & the Search Workflow</h3>
                    <p class="lead">The user workflow typically involves:
                    	<ul class="lead">
							<li>Search: The user enters terms into a search engine (usually Google)</li>
							<li>Discovery: The user sees the content in search results</li>
							<li>Interpretation: The user decides on relevance of the content (or preview content)</li>
							<li>Conversion: The user clicks on the content, finds what they need and implements best practice</li>							
							</ul> 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Search: Words Matter!</h3>
	                     <p class="lead">The language you use in your content may not align with the words your potential users enter into search engines.</p>
	                     <p class="lead"><em><strong>Determine the words that people use when searching for related content - include these words in your content.</strong></em></p>
								<p class="lead">Although it is important to align your content with the terms that people use during search, you shouldn't focus on stuffing content with keywords.</p>
								<p class="lead">Indeed, this practice is frowned upon by Google, and may cause your content to lose search rank.</p><p class="lead">Focus on 
								good quality content that is useful for your visitors - but include search keywords in a natural way.</p>						
							<h3>Search Ranking: Prominence</h3>
								<p class="lead">Search engines use a range of signals to decide on how to rank a site for a particular search term. These signals are usually secret - to prevent 
								"gaming" of search engines.</p>
								<p class="lead">Google have stated that they use more than 200 signals. Probably the most important determinant of search prominence 
								is the number of backlinks to your site.</p>

												Search Ranking
											</h3>
										</div>
										<div class="modal-body">
											<p class="lead">It is important that your web content is discoverable. Ideally, your online resources should be ranked highly in search engine results pages for relevant 
											keywords so that people can find the content easily.</p>
											<p class="lead">Search engines (like Google, Yahoo! and Bing) are basically robots that read every website on the internet, 
											creating an index based on what they read.</p>
											<p class="lead">Google is by far the most commonly used search engine, with <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#search_engine-ww-monthly-201205-201305">91% of 
											worldwide search traffic</a> taking place on Google.</p>
											<p class="lead"> Other search engines (e.g. Bing &amp; Yahoo) are likely to use very similar methods to index content and 
											rank search results - so it is fairly safe to focus on Google.</p>
											<p class="lead"><i><b>Google uses more than 200 different signals to rank websites and these signals are not completely public.</b></i>
											<p class="lead"> 
											The lack of transparency is designed to prevent site owners from “gaming” the system. These recommendations are based on the information that Google makes available and current 
											best practice in terms of search engine optimisation.</p>
											<p class="lead">When a user searches for a term in Google, the search engine goes through the index that it 
											created when it last crawled the web. Google then displays the search results that it thinks are most relevant for the user, based 
											primarily on the search terms they used. The order in which Google displays results is based on the popularity of the various sites, keyword density, 
											and other factors - so the user sees a list of sites that the search engine believes are most relevant, ranked accordingly.</p>
										<h3>Search Engine Optimisation</h3>
											<p class="lead">Site content should be written primarily for human users. However, creating the best website in the world is pointless if it is not optimised for search engines - few people will ever see it.</p>
											<p class="lead">Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is the process of optimising your website so that it is prominently 
											displayed in search engine results listings for targeted keywords. SEO involves careful crafting of content so that it is easily 
											accessible by both human users and search engines.
											</p>
											</p>
											<p class="lead">Usually, the higher a website is ranked on a results page, the more people will click through from the search engine and visit the content.</p>
											<p class="lead">To rank highly in search engines for a given search term:
										
												<ul class="lead">
													<li>Content must be indexed by search engines - content must be ”readable”, which means that HTML sites are good whereas Flash based sites are not</li>
													<li>Content should be original and useful for users</li>
													<li>Content should have good backlinks - authoritative external sites have links pointing to the site</li>
													<li>Content should have good social proof - content is shared on social media, and site authors are individually verified</li>
													<li>Content should be presented on a website that is uncluttered, free from malicious code, free from misleading adverts and is <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> compliant</li>
												</ul></p>
											<p class="lead">There are a number of methods that can be used to increase the prominence of web pages in search engine results listings:
										
												<ul class="lead">
													<li>Cross linking within a website can improve visibility for a target page</li>
													<li>Including appropriate frequently searched keywords in content and meta-data (title tags &amp; meta-description)</li>
													<li>Updating content regularly</li>
													<li>High quality backlinks (incoming links)</li>
												</ul></p>
											<p class="lead">According to Google themselves, webmasters should:</p>
											<p class="lead"><em><strong>"Create a useful, information-rich site, and write pages that clearly and accurately describe your content."</strong></em></p>
											<p class="lead"><a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=35769">Google Webmaster Guidelines</a>, accessed 13 March 2014</p>
										<h3>Backlinks</h3>
											<p class="lead">There are many factors that influence search engine rankings. However, it is likely that one major ranking factor is 
											the quantity and quality of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlink">backlinks</a>" (incoming links) that a site has. 
											This is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a>, and is the original indexing algorithm used by Google. 
											Other search engines probably use similar criteria. Incoming links from credible related sites are likely to strongly contribute to a site’s position in search 
											engine results pages. Content authors should therefore attempt to connect and engage with related sites in a natural and unforced manner.</p>
											<p class="lead">Search engines may penalise sites that engage in “dishonest” link building strategies such as the practice of buying
										 links. Search engines may also ignore <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_building">reciprocal links</a>, since these are not 
										 a true reflection of site quality/popularity.</p>
											<p class="lead">“Any links intended to manipulate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> or a site's ranking in Google search results 
											may be considered part of a link scheme and a violation of Google’s <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/answer.py?answer=35769">Webmaster Guidelines</a>.
											This includes any behavior that manipulates links to your site or outgoing links from your site. The following are examples of link schemes 
											which can negatively impact a site's ranking in search results:
												<ul class="lead">
													<li>Buying or selling links that pass <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a>. This includes exchanging money for links, or posts that contain links; exchanging goods or services for links; or sending someone a “free” product in exchange for them writing about it and including a link</li>
													<li>Excessive link exchanges ("Link to me and I'll link to you") or partner pages exclusively for the sake of cross-linking</li>
													<li>Large-scale article marketing or guest posting campaigns with keyword-rich anchor text links</li>
													<li>Using automated programs or services to create links to your site”</li>

		                	<p>Clear guidelines on "content-scraping" and the impact it has on search ranking. In short, if your site shows external content, you must add significant value to the content.</p>

					 <h3>Standing Out in Search</h3>
					 	<p class="lead">Title tags and meta-descriptions are the titles and descriptions that are displayed on search engine results pages.</p>
					 	<p class="lead">These pieces of information are often the first experience that users have of your online content.</p>
					 	<p class="lead">Title tags and meta descriptions should include relevant keywords, and be easily understood by your users. 
					 	In addition, these elements are used by search engines to determine what a web page is about.</p>
					 	<p class="lead">People are more likely to click on a particular result if there is a compelling title & description on the search engine result page.</p>
					 	<p class="lead">Titles should be no longer than 70 characters, and descriptions no longer than 150 characters - if they exceed these values, search engines will truncate
					 	 them.</p>
					 	 <h3>Online Strategy: Summary</h3>
					 	 <ul class="lead">
							<li>Be unique - do something cool which sets you apart from the competition</li>
							<li>Create excellent content - which is highly valued by users</li>
							<li>Include relevant keywords in your content</li>				 	 
							<li>Have a site that is well optimised for users - good navigation, excellent content</li>
							<li>Have good, accurate title tags and meta-descriptions</li>
							<li>Check your stats - Google Webmaster Tools, Google Analytics</li>
							<li>Be agile - respond to site traffic data</li>
							<li>Attract buzz - source natural links, get social shares, run campaigns</li>
							<li>Stay fresh - blog about current issues and evaluate and archive old, less relevant content</li>

					 <h4>Title Tags & Meta Descriptions</h4>
					 	<p>This image highlights the title tag with a blue arrow and the meta description with a red arrow</p>
					 	<img class="img-responsive" src="img/seo-screenshot.png" alt="">
					 <h4>Authorship</h4>
					 	<p>Note that in the image above some of the results have author images.
					 	It is likely that Google ranks pages higher when authorship of the page has been verified.
					 	This trend has been evident for a while, and it looks like it will become more important.</p>
					 	<p><blockquote>"Within search results, information tied to verified online profiles will be ranked higher than content 
					 	without such verification, which will result in most users naturally clicking on the top (verified) results. 
					 	The true cost of remaining anonymous, then, might be irrelevance.”</blockquote> Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman, Google (2013)</p>
					 	<p>In other words, it is likely that content created by verified authors will rank higher in search engine results pages - 
					 	making content more discoverable and increasing the potential audience. In addition, being active in social networks will 
					 	probably improve search engine ranking for an author. Because of this, content-creators should probably undergo Google authorship verification.</p>
					 	<p>Having Google authorship makes a site listing in a search engine results page stand out. 
					 	It also adds a human element to content - which is attributed to an actual person, with a link to that person’s Google+ page. 
					 	Google authorship allows an individual's online work to be linked and in all likelihood makes it easier to become established as an expert 
					 	in the eyes of search engines.</p>
